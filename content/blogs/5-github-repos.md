## Top 5 GitHub Repositories to Boost Your Development Workflow

Explore these five open-source tools designed to streamline your coding process and improve productivity.

### 1. Qodo-Merge

> Qodo Merge is an open-source tool designed to streamline the review and management of pull requests (PRs) by providing AI-powered feedback and suggestions.

With Qodo-Merge, you can automate the code review process for all pull requests, ensuring that only high-quality code gets merged into the main codebase. It uses the GPT-4 model by default (requires an OpenAI API Key), but you can customize it with your preferred model. Interact with the PR Agent directly on your public GitHub repository by mentioning `@CodiumAI-Agent` and using commands like:

- `/describe` – Generates PR description, including title, type, summary, code walkthrough, and labels.
- `/review` – Provides adjustable feedback about the PR, possible issues, security concerns, review effort, and more.
- `/improve` – Offers code suggestions for improving the PR.
- `/ask` – Responds to free-text questions about the PR or specific code lines.
